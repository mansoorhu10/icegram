# IceGram

IceGram is a photo gallery created with React and Firebase.

## How I worked on this project
My goal was to create a simple web application with simple functionality that allows me to learn new skills.
  * I followed along through a YouTube tutorial called [FireGram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUe91uOx7R0&t=652s).
  * I built the extension from scratch using React, Firebase, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
  
## Why I built the project this way
I wanted to improve my skills with React and the way that I organize code to learn proper folder structure in a project as well as learn how to use a non-relational database to store data.

## Future Improvements
I have lots of ideas to further my learning my tinkering around with different things using this web app as a base to work off of. These are the primary changes and improvements I will make to the app:

  * Figuring out how to add user authentication, log in, and sign up functionality and learning how to properly secure the process of signing in on the website.
  * Adding functionality such as arrows to browse through maximized images on your page.
  * Adding an explore page to view photos that other users publicly submit.
  * Adding a commenting feature so that users can comment on public photos.
